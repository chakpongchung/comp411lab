# comp411lab

Lab code (`C` and `MIPS` assembly) for *COMP 411: Computer Organization and Design*

`Lab 1` â€“ `Lab 5` are written with only C code, whereas from `Lab 6` onwards the assembly code is more important. For complicated problems, C code was written first to aid the composition of assembly code.

Sample inputs and outputs are provided in the `samples` folder.
